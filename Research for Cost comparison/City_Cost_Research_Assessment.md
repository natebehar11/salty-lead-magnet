## Comparison Effectiveness Ranking

1. **New York — $3,611 USD** → STRONGEST. Both in USD, the gap is massive and clean. NYC is also the city where the absurdity of replicating SALTY is most obvious (Rockaway in February, $70 dinners, $37 CrossFit drop-ins).

2. **Toronto — $3,369 CAD** → STRONG. Highest Canadian total. Lake surfing is the perfect punchline. $250/night for a Drake-tier hotel vs. beachside accommodation included with SALTY.

3. **Vancouver — $3,065 CAD** → STRONG. The Tofino surf comparison is gold — "It's only a 5-hour drive. Each way." Rain punchline lands perfectly in February.

4. **Montreal — $2,952 CAD** → GOOD. French punchline is memorable. The Tremblant ski day as "surf equivalent" highlights the seasonal absurdity. Montreal food is genuinely good value which keeps the total honest.

5. **Ottawa — $2,735 CAD** → MODERATE. Lower total reflects Ottawa's lower cost of living. Camp Fortune as the adventure comparison is relatable for local audience. Works well given Ottawa is SALTY's home base — "you already know what this costs."

6. **Halifax — $2,450 CAD** → MODERATE-WEAK on price alone. The total is the lowest because Halifax is genuinely affordable. **But the comparison still works** because: (a) the "ocean was 4°C" punchline is devastating, (b) the surf lesson description ("The water is 4°C. The wetsuit is mandatory.") makes the value prop visceral, and (c) even at $2,450 CAD, the user is getting a hotel room, some gym drop-ins, and cold ocean vs. SALTY's all-inclusive warm-water experience.

## Methodology Notes

### Accommodation
**Tier:** Mid-premium boutique. The spec says "not the Ritz, not a hostel." We targeted 4-star boutique hotels in each city's most relevant neighborhood.

| City | Reference Properties | Per-Night Rate | Rationale |
|------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Toronto | Drake Hotel ($231-287), Broadview Hotel ($219) | $250 | King West / Queen East boutique tier |
| Ottawa | Andaz Ottawa ($125-314) | $185 | ByWard Market, Feb low season |
| Vancouver | Opus Hotel ($234), Loden ($186) | $210 | Yaletown / Coal Harbour mid-premium |
| Halifax | Muir Hotel, Halliburton ($129-175) | $165 | Waterfront, limited premium supply |
| Montreal | Hotel Nelligan ($151-337), Le Petit Hotel ($147-252) | $225 | Old Montreal heritage boutique |
| New York | The Ludlow ($228-290), Moxy Chelsea | $250 | Lower Manhattan boutique |

### Meals
**Methodology:** Real restaurant averages per city. Breakfast at quality café (not fast food), lunch at sit-down restaurant, dinner at quality restaurant including one drink. Montreal and Halifax are genuinely cheaper for food — we didn't inflate to make the comparison better.

| City | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner | Daily | 7 Days |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Toronto | $18 | $24 | $48 | $90 | $630 |
| Ottawa | $16 | $22 | $42 | $80 | $560 |
| Vancouver | $19 | $26 | $50 | $95 | $665 |
| Halifax | $15 | $20 | $40 | $75 | $525 |
| Montreal | $16 | $22 | $48 | $86 | $602 |
| New York (USD) | $16 | $31 | $70 | $117 | $819 |

### Fitness
**Methodology:** Mix of CrossFit drop-ins and yoga drop-ins to mirror SALTY's daily fitness programming. Rates sourced from studio websites.

Key finding: CrossFit drop-in rates are remarkably consistent in Canada ($25-30 CAD) and higher in NYC ($35-40 USD). Yoga varies more widely ($12-32 depending on city).

### Adventure/Surf
**Methodology:** The spec specifically calls for the "closest equivalent" to surfing, and notes the comparison should be "slightly absurd — because the honest truth is that you CAN'T replicate the SALTY experience at home."

| City | Adventure | Why It's Funny |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Toronto | Great Lakes surf lesson ($99) | "Yes, a lake." |
| Ottawa | Ski day at Camp Fortune ($125) | Not quite Costa Rica |
| Vancouver | Tofino surf lesson ($200) | 5-hour drive each way |
| Halifax | Lawrencetown Beach surf ($95) | Water is 4°C |
| Montreal | Ski day at Tremblant ($150) | 90 min traffic each way |
| New York | Rockaway Beach surf ($100) | Hour on the A train, February Atlantic |

### Photography
**Methodology:** 1-hour on-location lifestyle photography session. Rates from Thumbtack, photographer websites, and local market averages. Montreal is cheapest ($250) due to market density; Toronto and NYC highest ($400) due to demand.

### Nightlife
**Methodology:** 3 nights out, each including venue cover charge + 4 drinks. Prices reflect each city's primary nightlife district. Montreal and Ottawa are significantly cheaper for nightlife than Toronto, Vancouver, or NYC.

## Taxes — Why They're Excluded

The spec's sample data shows pre-tax prices. Including taxes would add:
- **Ontario (Toronto/Ottawa):** 13% HST → adds ~$350-440
- **BC (Vancouver):** 12% combined → adds ~$370
- **Nova Scotia (Halifax):** 15% HST → adds ~$370
- **Quebec (Montreal):** 14.975% combined → adds ~$440
- **NYC:** ~8.875% + various → adds ~$320

Including taxes would push every Canadian city $350-440 higher. We excluded them for consistency with the spec and because the comparison works without inflating numbers.

## Key Observations

### What Drives the Home Cost
Accommodation is 45-55% of every city's total. This is where the comparison hits hardest — a solo traveler paying $165-250/night for a boutique hotel vs. SALTY's group rate with premium beachside accommodation included.

### Where the Absurdity Lives
The adventure/surf line item is the emotional center of this comparison. The dollar amount is small ($95-200), but the description is what makes people share this card. "Surf lesson on a lake" and "The water is 4°C" are the lines that stick.

### Honest Weaknesses
- **Halifax total ($2,450 CAD)** is close to or below SALTY's prices when converted to USD. The comparison needs the punchline and line-item descriptions to carry the value argument, not the price gap.
- **Ottawa total ($2,735 CAD)** is also modest. But Ottawa being SALTY's home base means this audience already gets the brand — the card reinforces rather than convinces.
- **Montreal's food value** is genuinely good. The $602 meal total is honest — Montreal offers exceptional dining at reasonable prices. Don't fight this; it builds trust.

### The Real Argument
The totals matter less than the qualitative gap. Every city card makes the same implicit argument: "You can spend $2,500-3,600 at home and get a hotel room, some gym sessions, and a surf lesson on a lake/in freezing water. Or you can spend $1,949-2,399 USD and get warm ocean surfing, professional coaching, 30 new friends, all meals, all activities, and zero planning." The numbers set up the punchline. The punchline closes the sale.
