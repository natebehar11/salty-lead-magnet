## What Changed from v1

The first version used budget/mid-range accommodation ($40-72/night) and cheap restaurant meals ($8-15). That methodology was wrong — it compared SALTY against a backpacker's trip, not against someone replicating the actual SALTY experience.

**v2 corrects this with:**

**Accommodation:** Premium boutique hotels, 4-star properties, eco-lodges at the level SALTY actually books. A solo traveler paying retail for La Moresca in Sicily (€220/night), Lapa Rios in Costa Rica ($400/night), or Boca Olas in El Salvador ($230/night) faces the full single-occupancy rate that SALTY splits across 4+ guests.

**Meals:** Multi-course (appetizer + main + drink minimum) at quality restaurants. SALTY's chef-prepared meals include at least two courses plus a beverage — restaurant equivalents must match.

**Activities:** Every single included activity priced, no exceptions. If SALTY includes daily yoga in a location where no studios exist (Osa Peninsula, rural Sicily), the DIY traveler must pay for private instruction.

**Transfers:** Private transfers where SALTY provides private group transport. A solo traveler paying full vehicle rate for Panama City → Santa Catalina ($530) highlights the group buying power.

## Recommended Tool Priority

Based on comparison strength, the tool should feature destinations in this order:

1. **Costa Rica** — Lead with this. Accommodation alone ($2,800) exceeds SALTY's total price. Yoga/fitness literally unavailable as drop-in. Strongest possible case.

2. **Sicily** — Peak August pricing makes this compelling. Car rental requirement, premium beach clubs, and private yoga instruction drive DIY to nearly $4,100.

3. **Panama** — Two-city logistics and private inter-city transfers ($530) make solo DIY expensive. Strong comparison.

4. **El Salvador** — Moderate but honest. The luxury villa with 4 private pools is genuinely irreplicable for a solo traveler.

5. **Morocco** — Thin margin (8%) against lowest tier. Consider showing against the shared or double tier instead, where SALTY delivers $218+ more value.

6. **Sri Lanka** — Thinnest margin (4%) against dorm tier. Sri Lanka is genuinely very affordable. Best framed around logistics complexity and coaching quality, not raw cost.

## Key Insight: Where the Savings Come From

SALTY's value isn't evenly distributed across line items. The biggest savings come from three categories:

**Accommodation (50-65% of gap):** A solo traveler paying full retail for a premium property that SALTY negotiates group rates on. SALTY gets 20%+ under market, then splits across 4+ guests per room. This is where the math really works.

**Fitness/Yoga (5-12% of gap):** SALTY brings coaches. In remote destinations (Osa, rural Sicily), there are literally no public studios — a solo DIY traveler would need private instruction at $50-80/session, or simply can't access daily workouts.

**Private Transfers (5-15% of gap):** Multi-location retreats (Panama, Sri Lanka) require expensive private car transfers. SALTY splits the vehicle across 20-30 guests. Solo travelers pay full rate.
