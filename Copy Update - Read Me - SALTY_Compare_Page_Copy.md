## HERO SECTION

**Stamp Badge:** YOUR TRIP, HANDLED

**Subtitle (small, above H1):** The real cost of doing it yourself

**H1:** We did the homework so you don't have to.

**Subtext (2-3 lines max):**
We priced out every accommodation, surf lesson, yoga class, excursion, and meal across our retreat destinations. Then we compared it to what you'd actually pay doing it all yourself. The result? SALTY costs less, includes more, and gives you back the 40+ hours you'd spend planning.

## METHODOLOGY / VALUE FRAMING SECTION

**This replaces the current dry "methodology disclaimer" with a short value-framing block.**

**Header:** How we built this comparison

**Body copy:**
We searched Airbnb, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and local activity providers for every destination. We priced things the way a real traveler would: mid-range accommodation, reputable surf schools, actual restaurant menus, and real excursion costs. No inflated numbers. Every price links to its source so you can check for yourself.

But here's what the spreadsheet doesn't capture. When you book with SALTY, you're not just saving money. You're skipping the 40+ hours of research, the back-and-forth with Airbnb hosts, the gamble on a surf school you found on page three of Google, and the stress of coordinating logistics in a country you've never been to.

You show up. We handle everything else.

**Small text / link:** Tap any price in the breakdowns below to see exactly where it came from.

## "PRICELESS" SECTION — REPOSITIONED

**Current state:** Buried at the bottom of each card as an afterthought.
**New state:** Elevated to a standalone section ABOVE the destination cards, framing the entire comparison.

**Header:** What the numbers can't show you

**Layout:** 4 cards in a row (or 2×2 on mobile), each with emoji + short headline + one-liner.

**Card 1:**
👥 **30 instant friends**
Most guests come solo. Within 24 hours, strangers become your crew. That group chat lives on long after you're home.

**Card 2:**
📋 **Zero planning required**
Accommodation, meals, workouts, excursions, transfers, schedule. All handled. You pack a bag and show up.

**Card 3:**
💪 **World-class coaching**
Daily programming from coaches who've trained at the Olympics, Cirque du Soleil, and top studios across Canada. Not a random class you found online.

**Card 4:**
📸 **Professional content**
You'll come home with photos and video you'd normally need to hire a photographer for. No awkward selfie sticks required.

## TRANSITION INTO COMPARISON CARDS

**Header:** Now let's talk numbers.

**Subtext:**
Every retreat below is broken down line by line. Same destination, same activities, same duration. One planned by you. One planned by us.

---

## COMPARISON CARD COPY UPDATES

### Card Header (no change to structure, update copy)

**Current:** Just retreat name + destination + nights
**Add:** One-line vibe descriptor per destination

Examples:
- Costa Rica: "Jungle meets ocean. Surf, sweat, and howler monkeys."
- Sri Lanka: "Coast to mountains. Nine days, two worlds."
- Panama: "Skyline to shoreline. City energy, coastal calm."
- Morocco: "Surf breaks and souks. Small group, big adventure."
- Sicily: "Peak summer. Beach clubs, baroque towns, and pasta you'll dream about."
- El Salvador: "Private villas, rooftop pools, and El Tunco's best surf break outside your door."

### Savings Banner Copy

**Current:** "Save $X,XXX with SALTY"
**Revised options by savings level:**

- **$500+ savings:** "Save $[X] and skip 40+ hours of planning"
- **$200-499 savings:** "Same price, none of the stress. Plus 30 new friends."
- **Under $200 savings:** "Similar cost. Wildly different experience."

This handles the El Salvador problem — when savings are minimal, the framing shifts to value and experience rather than dollar amount.

### Expandable Breakdown Toggle

**Current:** "See full breakdown (X items)"
**Revised:** "See exactly where every dollar goes (X items)"

### Inside the Breakdown Table

**Current column headers:** Item | DIY Cost | SALTY
**Revised column headers:** What you'd need | Doing it yourself | With SALTY

### Source Links

**Current:** "Airbnb Nosara →"
**Revised:** "Verify on Airbnb →" / "Check on TripAdvisor →" / "See pricing →"

This language explicitly invites verification, which builds trust.

---

## BOTTOM CTA SECTION

**Current:** "Ready to save?" + buttons
**Revised:**

**Header:** Your week is waiting.

**Subtext:**
Pick a trip, search your flights, and let us handle the rest. No spreadsheets. No stress. Just show up ready to sweat, explore, and have a damn good time.

**Buttons:**
- "Find Your Trip" → `/quiz` (primary)
- "Search Flights" → `/flights` (secondary)

**WhatsApp HumanCTA:**
"Still deciding? We're real humans. Ask us anything."

## COPY PRINCIPLES APPLIED

- **No "transformative journey" language.** This is practical, confident, human.
- **Lead with time and stress saved**, not just dollars. Most people's biggest constraint is decision fatigue, not budget.
- **"We did the homework"** positions SALTY as the smart friend who figured it all out, not a corporation selling a package.
- **Source link transparency** is the trust builder. "Check for yourself" is more persuasive than "trust us."
- **Community framing** is woven throughout, not bolted on. The "30 instant friends" card does more selling than any price comparison.
- **The framing shifts based on savings level.** Strong savings = lead with dollars. Weak savings = lead with experience and convenience.
- **"Show up and we handle everything"** is the core promise repeated in different ways.

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

- The "What the numbers can't show you" section should feel visually distinct from the comparison cards. Different background color, card-based layout, breathing room.
- On mobile, the 4 priceless cards should stack as a swipeable carousel or 2×2 grid, not a long vertical list.
- The methodology block should be collapsible on mobile (tap to expand) but visible on desktop.
- Share tray (WhatsApp to self, email to self, email to friend) should appear on each comparison card AND as a page-level action.
